## Fort Wayne Raising Part 1

I study Linguistics, or the way that people speak and perceive language. I’m particularly interested in American dialects, which is when most people perk up and give me examples of dialectal features that they know about, like how people say, “water fountain” versus “bubbler” or “pop,” “soda,” or “coke” regionally—and this is exactly what I do! I study sounds rather than differences in entire words, and focus on something that my coauthors and I have called “American raising,” as a nod to a much more famous process called Canadian raising. Canadian raising is actually pretty salient and what we imitate when we say things like “about” and “house” in a “Canadian” accent. You can probably hear that something is going on with the vowels in those words, and that something is perceptual raising. The same type of raising happens in words like “write” and “bite,” in Canada and also in a variety of different US dialects from the upper Midwest, to Philadelphia, to Kansas City, and now to northeast Indiana.

The most interesting thing about the raising that happens in Indiana is that it’s quite new, and seemingly unconnected to other raising dialects. The raising feature has only been noticed in the area in about the past decade and is currently in the process of evolving to become more advanced. If you’ve ever tried to read Shakespeare, or Chaucer, or even Beowulf (good luck there), you’ve probably noticed that you can understand some or even most of the language, but there are some interesting differences that you might need to look up to even understand the meaning of. This is because language naturally changes over time—think about the evolution of the meaning of the word “gay.” It was a synonym for happy around 1900, and then became a derogatory word for homosexual somewhere around the 1950s. Since then, the word has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community, and still means homosexual but has lost some of the negative connotations. Sounds of a language can undergo change in a similar way, which is even sometimes reflected in modern spelling (knight, anyone?).

Fort Wayne raising is a new and exciting change that we seem to have caught right at the beginning of the change. There’s still currently a lot of variation among speakers—some people pronounce “ride” and “write” exactly the same, while others pronounce them differently, “write” with the raised vowel and “ride” with the unraised vowel. These are the two extreme ends of the continuum of raising that exists in Fort Wayne, with a few intermediary cases that don’t fit neatly into either category. This is a really unique situation in which researchers are able to capture a speech community at a time when not everyone produces speech sounds the same way, although speakers seem to be trending towards adopting the change. All of the work done on Fort Wayne raising so far has been in documenting the different ways that people produce the vowel, whether raised or unraised in specific contexts. This is really important and interesting work, but for language to happen, there is usually back-and-forth communication between two people, including at least one speaker and one listener. The listener is studied much less often than the speaker in sound change scenarios, and that’s the part of the communication equation I am focusing now.

For my dissertation work, I’m interested in the changes that need to happen cognitively in order for sound change to occur. I am in the process of building several experiments to investigate whether people in Fort Wayne perceive the sound change in exactly the same way that they produce it. One of my big questions is whether people can perceive the difference between the raised and unraised vowels before they produce this difference, because to most average listeners, raising is hard to hear, bordering on imperceptible. Another question I have is whether the sound change has become part of what’s called the speaker’s internal grammar—internal grammar could be defined by whether or not the change has cemented itself in the speaker’s brain, in this instance.

I’m excited to study sound change and cognitive processes in this context, especially in the area where I grew up! I plan to do more writing about my research, so check back if you’re interested, or reach out at alyssa.strickler@colorado.edu with any questions.
